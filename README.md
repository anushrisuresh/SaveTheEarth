Heroes are made by the path they choose, not the powers they are graced with.

â€“ Iron Man

Iron Man was introduced by Marvel Comics in the comic book Tales of Suspense #39 in March 1963. The creators were Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck, and Jack Kirby. 

What are Iron Man's powers? 

Iron Man possesses a wealth of powers through his powered armor suit. These powers include super strength, the ability to fly, durability, and a number of weapons. The primary weapons used by Iron Man are rays that are shot from the palms of his gauntlets. 

Who is Iron Man's alter ego and how did he get his powers? 

Iron Man gets his superpowers from his metallic suit of armor and other technologies invented by his alter ego Tony Stark. Tony is a genius engineer and wealthy owner of a technology company. Tony built the Iron Man suit when he was kidnapped and suffered an injury to his heart. The suit was meant to save his life and help him escape. 

Tony also has an improved artificial nervous system which gives him greater healing powers, super perception, and the ability to merge with his suit of armor. Outside of his armor he has been trained in hand-to-hand combat.
